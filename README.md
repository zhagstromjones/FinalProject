# FinalProject
MyAgenda Program
Author: Zach Hagstrom-Jones

Overview

The application for my final project is a program called MyAgenda. The program is a digital classwork agenda to let students organize their educational tasks in an “at-a-glance” environment. The main part of the application is the ‘notebook’ which uses a Treeview module to put information into a spreadsheet. The user can add, overwrite, and delete items within the notebook. The program also features a fully-functional calculator that can process basic arithmetic expressions.

Starting the Application

MyAgenda requires Python to be installed on your computer. If Python is not installed, the program will not start. To install Python, please visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and follow the instructions. To start the MyAgenda application, simply double-click on the myagenda.py file.

User Commands

Once the program has launched there will be sample data within the record fields of the notebook. This data is present to show the user how to operate the program.

Within the “Add New Task” frame, the user can input text of a course that they are currently taking, the chapter or unit within the course, and a task associated with that chapter/unit; clicking the “Add Task” button adds this information to the notebook portion of the application in the form of a record. The “Clear Fields” button clears the input fields of their current data. The user can select one record in the notebook by clicking on it, and multiple records by holding either Shift and clicking (to select multiple records in a row) or holding Ctrl and clicking (to select multiple records one at a time). Using the “Overwrite Selected” button, the user can overwrite information on the top-most selected record with data that is currently in the input fields.

The user can delete records with the “Delete Selected” button. The “Calculator” button opens an instance of the calculator, and the “Exit Program” button exits the program. When using the calculator, the user can input numbers by typing them directly from their keyboard, as well as the basic arithmetic operators for addition (“+”), subtraction (“-“), multiplication (“*”), and division (“/”). However, the square and square root functions will have to be clicked with the mouse cursor. The user can calculate expressions by pressing the Enter key or clicking the “=” button and can place decimals by pressing the “.” key or clicking the “.” button. The entire current expression can be cleared by clicking the “C” button or pressing the “Esc” key.

Exiting the Program

To exit the program, click the “Exit Program” button or click the X at the top-right portion of the application window.
